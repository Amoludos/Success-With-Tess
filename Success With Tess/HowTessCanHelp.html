			<p>While we may discuss these topics during our coaching, I do not provide therapy or
			   therapeutic counseling, professional medical or financial advice. However, I am more
			   than happy to provide you with names for providers of those services who I highly recommend.<br  />
			   The coaching process is comprised of conversations between you and me where we work 
			   together on where you want to be and how you will get there.  
			   You will experience honesty, integrity, and my confidential support. 
			   I am committed to helping you succeed.

	<blockquote>
      For me the simplest way to look at Tess's coaching abilities is to look at my life before our
	  conversations and after. I did the work, anyone coached does the work, but with questions she
	  exploded a lot of limiting assumptions which were impacting my motivation to live the life I
	  wanted to live. <br  /><br  />
	  If you don't feel free... then what is freedom worth to you? I couldn't answer that question
	  when I started; I forgot what it was like to feel free, not sure if I ever really was before.
	  But now that I have that freedom within, I know that it's worth any price to have, and to preserve,
	  I'd never go back to the way I was living ever again.
