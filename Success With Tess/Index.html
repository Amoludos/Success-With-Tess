	<blockquote>
      For me the simplest way to look at Tess's coaching abilities is to look at my life before our
	  conversations and after. I did the work, anyone coached does the work, but with questions she
	  exploded a lot of limiting assumptions which were impacting my motivation to live the life I
	  wanted to live. <br  /><br  />
	  If you don't feel free... then what is freedom worth to you? I couldn't answer that question
	  when I started; I forgot what it was like to feel free, not sure if I ever really was before.
	  But now that I have that freedom within, I know that it's worth any price to have, and to preserve,
	  I'd never go back to the way I was living ever again.
